Duality is a video game prototype built around a cool shader effect. It is meant to be a puzzle game, with two worlds that are mirror images of each other. These worlds, though they cannot touch, can influence each other in certain ways. This is a prototype an is largely unfinished.
## Setup
Clone the repo. To run the game, run:
```Bash
./gradlew desktop:run
```
